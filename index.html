                  each other or just to hold hands on a bad day.</strong> </p>
                <p class="text-justify"> As technology advances, we can now text or video-chat with our partner to share every little thing that happen around us at approximately the same time. Still, the means of interaction might
                  be <i>limited to words and stickers.</i> <strong>Physical interactions and hence the playfulness might be sacrificed.</strong></p>

                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Solution Overview</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify"> Face Dance Challenge (FDC) is <i>originally a mobile-based application/game</i> that allows users to score by changing their facial expression according to the emojis that show up on screen. However, in this version of FDC, it isn‚Äôt a mobile
                  application itself. Instead, it‚Äôs designed to be <strong>an extension in the Facebook Messenger</strong>, aiming to spice up interaction between couples in LDRs. The design of FDC is <i>based on the video-chat and gaming feature that Messenger already supports.</i>
                  However, it also allows physical interaction and the sense of touch to be <strong>transmitted via the vibration or haptic feedback of iPhones.</strong> Namely, FDC is a game that features <strong>a combination of image, sound and physical interaction.</strong> This combination
                  makes up for the problem that couples in LDRs create less shared memories due to geographic barriers. By playing games while video chatting, couples can <strong>see each other‚Äôs facial expression and listen to their screams and laughter as if
                  they were on each other‚Äôs sides.</strong> </p>

                <br>
                <!-- Problem Exploration -->
                <p class="text-justify"> At the problem exploration stage, I went through several boards of a popular BBS forum in Taiwan, called PTT, which has conserved online discussion data <strong>for more than 20 years.</strong> The boards I referred to includes Boy-Girl, Sex and Long-Distant. The user research method I used is <strong>a mixure of diary study and semi-constructed interview</strong> -- I read through all the discussions that contains <i>key words like long distance relationship and problems</i> to identify the difficulties LDR couples face. Eventually, I found that not only sentimental communication but also <strong>physical interactions play a significant role in relationships.</strong> </p>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/competitive _analysis.png" alt="competitive analysis">
                <p class="text-center"> <i>Competitive Analysis</i> </p>
                <p class="text-justify"> Before I jump into the solution, I also did a competitive analysis on the current technological solutions available on the market. What surprised me was that despite the large number of LDR couples, <strong>all the software solutions I found on
                  the market target couples who can meet relatively frequently.</strong> Hence, the features of these solutions are based on storing created memories. Sadly, for LDR couples, if they cannot meet their partners in person, memories can be hard to
                  create. In that sense, these couples depend on contemplating on their good old days to maintain their attraction with their partners. </p>
                <p class="text-justify"> With these findings in mind, the final scope of my project was set ‚Äì <strong>(1) spicing up the interactions between couples, physical interactions included</strong> and <strong>(2) create something that is shared between these partners.</strong></p>
                <!-- Solution Ideation -->
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/brainstorm.png" alt="brainstorm/solution ideation">
                <p class="text-justify">After my project scope was defined, over the following design process, my solution focus has always been on the improvement of physical interaction between LDR couples. During ideation, I came up with <strong>8 potential solutions</strong> to the problem. Interestingly, almost all the ideas I came up with <i>require the users to buy extra products or services</i> such as gloves, meals or a sensor. Nonetheless, I have always <strong>kept the welfare of my target users in my mind and wanted to benefit as many couples in LDR as I do as possible</strong>, which
                  is the reason why I <strong>choose Messenger</strong> as the foundation of my final solution. </p>

                <p class="text-center"> <i>Wayne, Mina and Jeffery are Pro-personas while Tina is an Anti-persona.</i> </p>
                <p class="text-justify">To further identify my target users, I built 4 personas, including<strong> 3 pro-persona and 1 anti-persona.</strong> All of these personas are <strong>based on the discussions I read on the PTT forum, which are all true stories.</strong></p>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/storymap.png" alt="user storymap">
                <p class="text-justify">To check the validity of my final solution, I went through <strong>story-mapping to model user activities and their current potential ways of interacting with their couples.</strong> Finally, I <strong>iterate through <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JbCkS40tbirPz-eXj--dZ51ZmK9kenL9/view?usp=sharing">3 rounds of QOCs (Question, Options and Criteria)</a></strong> to explore the potential key features I want to include in my final design as well as how these features will be presented. </p>

                <p class="text-center"> <i>Low-fi prototype demonstration</i> </p>
                <p class="text-justify">With clearer picture of how my final design would be like, I started to work on my low-fi prototypes that <strong>models 10 tasks and 15+ interactions</strong> I would like to test. </p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Major Design Change</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/major design change.png" alt="major design change">
                <p class="text-justify"> The biggest design change occurred during my first user test on paper prototypes when <strong>my user told me that she had no idea that couples playing FDC are in charge of one side of the facial expression</strong> despite the instruction provided before the game starts. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">In the original design, the emoji would fly into the screen vertically from the bottom side of the screen. Since my user was <strong>confused about how to react when she saw an emoji flying on the other side of the screen,</strong> I decided that emoji would always fly in the middle from the bottom, <i>which sacrifice the level of difficulty but improves the interaction.</i> </p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Iterations</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">From the brainstorming to prototyping, <strong>I‚Äôm always thinking about my design.</strong> Whenever I have a new idea in my mind, I always talk to my boyfriend about it and discuss the pros and cons of it. Especially when I‚Äôm working on high-fi prototypes,
                  I <strong>come up with new designs every day</strong> and usually spend more than a half of prototyping time to refine the design I made earlier. Generating new ideas every day was hard; however, it turned out that I do have <strong>made a lot of breakthroughs
                  in terms of the visual representation as well as the interactions between screens and users.</strong> For instance, at first, the only way for my users to switch between screens was by tapping on the space on the screen but as I discovered more
                  about InVision, I eventually <i>set timer to switch between screens to make the motion of flying emoji much similar to how it would work in reality. </i></p>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">One Step Further</h4>
                <br>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/incentives.png" alt="design philosophy">
                <p class="text-center"> <i>Incentive-increasing features</i> </p>
                
                <p class="text-justify">My design philosophy has always been <strong>‚ÄúPeople respond to incentives.‚Äù</strong> Aside from maintaining consistency across the whole project, I always think one step further as of how to <strong>make my design appealing and attractive in the long run.</strong> Thus, an explicit feature that has to do with incentive-creating is the mechanism that <strong>couples can unlock more interactions as they score more points.</strong> Additionally, I add another line of word hinting the users on how far they are from the
                  new interaction. Other than that, I want to <strong>avoid LDR couples who play FDC to fight because of the game.</strong> Thus, the mechanism of the game itself awards good teamwork but <strong>if only one of the couple performs well, they can still gain points.</strong>
                  Through this scoring mechanism, I would like to convey the message that though it‚Äôs perfect that we, as a couple, can work well together, if it turns out to be just the opposite, it‚Äôs still okay because <strong>one‚Äôs strength can help make up for the other‚Äôs weakness.</strong></p>

                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Impact</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">The societal impact I would like to make on couples in LDR is that there‚Äôs <strong>no need to be afraid of the distance between them</strong> and their special ones and <strong>it‚Äôs okay to run out of things to share</strong> during video-chat. LDR couples are no different from ordinary couples. Though reminiscing the good old days helps them go through the dark lonely nights, <strong>couples can still create new memories in spite of being physically apart.</strong> </p>
                <p class="text-justify"> Through my design, I want to <strong>inspire more potential or future design for LDR couples</strong> as during my competitive analysis, I found that there‚Äôs less existing digital solutions designed just for LDR couples. </p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Takeaway</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">The hardest part of going through the design process is not design itself. Instead, for me, it‚Äôs <strong>conquering the fear of falling behind.</strong> I‚Äôm really fortunate to have Tonya as my instructor to boost me up when I felt that I could not see
                  my strength in the field of information with an economics background. However, as it turned out, my past-4-year <strong>training in economics does help me think more thoroughly and go one step forward to consider the long-run effect of my product.</strong></p>

                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/cycle.png" alt="Operation Model Cycle">
                <p class="text-justify"> Volunteers play a fundamental role in TBP‚Äôs product and service deliveries, which enable TBP to operate at the low-cost model. Following the expansion of store open hours and service to walk-in customers, recruiting more volunteers and maintaining
                  a stable volunteer base has become more critical to TBP‚Äôs long-term success. </p>
                <p class="text-justify"> To address the findings from the interviews and help TBP have sustainable growth, we therefore present four recommendations below: </p>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Recommendation 1: Strengthen Social Media Presence</strong> </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Currently, TBP runs 2 social media pages:
                <ol>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong> Facebook</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify"> Announce extra open hours</li>
                    <li class="text-justify"> Promote special sales events</li>
                    <li class="text-justify"> Share volunteer stories and experiences
                  </ul>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong> Instagram</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify"> Post photographs of brides who purchased their gowns from TBP
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">However, some more important things are missing:
                  <ul>
                  <li class="text-justify"> TBP‚Äôs uniqueness as a cancer-support NPO is not emphasized well</li>
                  <li class="text-justify"> No recruitment information can be found despite the increasing demand for volunteers.</li>
                  <li class="text-justify"> There does not appear to be a standard operational process or screening mechanism for its online social media strategies.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/workshop.png" alt="Social Media Workshop">
                <p class="text-justify">Hence, Wonder Women <i>provided a Social Media workshop and detailed guidelines on how to manage social media pages.</i> The following topics / advice are covered: </p>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/unique example.png" alt="TBP Uniqueness">
                <ol>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Clarify and emphasize information regarding open hours, the mission, and its nonprofit status</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="text-justify">Posts about extra open hours would be more effective if announced earlier and promoted heavily</li>
                      <li class="text-justify">Emphasize how TBP is different because that is why they are successful</li>
                      <li class="text-justify">When announcing hours, do so on the appropriate platforms (an Instagram caption leaves the post jumbled and hard to read)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Use photos that are of high definition and shows images of volunteers at work</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify">Only post high definition photos and images of volunteers at work shows the professionalism of TBP as a bridal shop</li>
                    <li class="text-justify">Keep a uniform ‚Äútheme‚Äù (color scheme, types of the same ‚ÄúI said yes to the dress!‚Äù photo, photos of dresses done in specific ways)</li>
                  </ul>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">With clear guidelines and examples provided, TBP can develop better understanding of content management strategies and the mechanism of how social media works. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Recommendation 2: Make Shop Feel More Homey</strong> </p>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/TBP_homey.png" alt="Make shop more homey">
                <p class="text-justify">The shop, located on the ground floor of a small shopping area, is well-lit and decorated with several dressing rooms and sitting areas. Bridal gowns occupy the same floor and are not in holding areas. <i>Currently, the front of the shop holds the TBP logo and a few framed photos along with a sign-in sheet and info placard.</i></p>
                <p class="text-left">Instead of replicating a bridal shop feel, TBP could showcase their commitment to their brides who come to TBP for many different reasons.
                <ol>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Pinterest Wall</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify"> Photos that customers send in of their wedding days in their gowns which may inspire and motivate the volunteers.</li> 
                    <li class="text-justify"> Photos of volunteers at events, bonding, and working fun campaigns can highlight the rewarding value of volunteering at TBP, perhaps inspiring both brides and prospective volunteers into becoming engaged with the organization.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Guest Book</strong></li> 
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify"> Instead of the sign in clipboard at the store front, reminiscent of guest books at special occasions (like weddings), would allow brides to leave comments for their volunteer consultants and allow volunteers to read their own praise.
                  </ul>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">These tactics to make the shop more "homey" would be an addition to the social media outreach that TBP undertakes and create an immediate wow-factor to the store. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Recommendation 3: Engage Volunteers with One Another</strong> </p>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/TBP_engage.png" alt="Engage volunteers">
                <p class="text-justify">Currently, there is very little engagement between volunteers outside of their shifts. Outside of the shop, the main form of communication between volunteers is via email. Usually these email interactions regard covering each other‚Äôs shifts.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Here, we suggest some tactics to improve the situation <strong>on a daily basis</strong>:
                <ol>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong> Encourage staff to work with someone they have not worked with before and would like to get to know. </strong></li>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Volunteer-generated recognition of their peers is a way to positively engage volunteers with one another.</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text-left">Place a box in the store so that volunteers can write a note of something that they <i>recognized another volunteer doing well.</i></li>
                  </ul>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">In addition to engaging volunteers on a day-to-day level, <strong>annual and semi-annual</strong> events should also be implemented to accomplish this goal:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Organize an annual all-staff celebration away from the shop or CSC.</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify">Our team learned that this has been attempted once in the past, but it is worth trying again. </li>
                    <li class="text-justify">In addition to being a celebration, it should also be a volunteer recognition event.</li>
                    <li class="text-justify">Fun is an important aspect of volunteer satisfaction and retention, so it should be in a space that is attractive to the majority of volunteers.</li>
                    <li class="text-justify">The event can also serves as a way for volunteers to get to know each other outside of a work environment.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify"><i>An all-staff meeting is not recommended.</i> Our team recognized that volunteers are busy and it can be somewhat difficult to schedule a time where the most possible people are available.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Recommendation 4: Recruitment Outreach</strong> </p>
                <p class="text-justify"> Although TBP has gradually developed its reputation as a volunteer-based bridal salon in Ann Arbor, the effectiveness of volunteer outreach has room for improvement:
                <ol>
                <li class="text-justify"><strong>Community Engagement</strong> </li>
                <ul>
                <li class="text-justify">Limited connection between TBP and the University of Michigan (UM) community and the greater Ann Arbor community. Not many people at UM are aware of this community engagement opportunity.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/sign up.png" alt="http://www.thebridesproject.org/support/volunteer/">
                <p class="text-center"> <i>The volunteer sign-up form on TBP‚Äôs official website</i> </p>
                <li class="text-justify"><strong>Recruitment</strong></li>
                <ul>
                <li class="text-justify"> We discovered in volunteer sign-up form on the official website that TBP <i>recruits not only bridal consultants,</i> but also other positions, such as outreach, social media, and events.</li>
                <li class="text-justify"> However, without promotion on social media, people would not know about the various volunteer opportunities if they did not visit the official website. </li>
              </ul>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify"> We generated 2 <strong>personas</strong> of potentilal volunteers to understand their preferences and motivations and design target outreach programs accordingly: </p>

                </ol>
                <br>
                <li class="text-justify"><strong>Generate Volunteer-Centric Content on Social Media</strong> </li>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text-justify">Use quotes of why people volunteer as the title or the hook of the post to attract potential candidates‚Äô attention</li>
                  <li class="text-justify">Include information with the type of work volunteers will do, on-board training, and time commitment along with their professional looks</li>
                  <li class="text-justify">Whenever possible, link recruitment forms to social media posts</li>
                  <li class="text-justify">Encourage volunteers to spread the word by sharing social media posts from TBP pages and tag people in the posts/photos to gain more exposure</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Conclusion</h4>
                <p class="text-justify"> Through contextual inquiry, we sought to address The Bride‚Äôs Projects desire to determine optimal open hours and staffing model. In addition to many findings, our team ultimately discovered that in order to determine optimal open hours,
                  the organization must recruit more volunteers. TBP should strengthen its social media presence, make the shop feel more homey, engage volunteers with each other, and emphasize its volunteer recruitment outreach as a way to increase volunteer
                  satisfaction and customer demand. </p>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Limitations</h4>
                <ul>
                <li class="text-justify"><strong>Minimal interaction with customers:</strong> Part of determining optimal open hours would have required interviews with customers, as optimal open hours requires a balance of the needs of TBP and customers.</li>
                <li class="text-justify"><strong>Interviewees:</strong> Interviewees were picked by the director, so these volunteers may not be fully representative of volunteers‚Äô opinions and experiences.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Takeaway</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/TBP_final.jpg" alt="Team Wonder Women">
                <p class="text-justify"> This is my first time to work on a truly multidisciplinary team, which is both cross-cultural and cross-profession. However, contrary to the barrier I expected, my team, Wonder Women, worked very well together, from the start to the end.
                  One of the key element that leads to the success of work is that we trust and respect each members‚Äô profession. </p>
                <p class="text-justify"> There are 4 members in our team ‚Äì two are Library and Archive students who are native speakers in English while the other two non-native members focuses on HCI with knowledge and background in economics or business. <strong>We figure out problem
                  as a team but work independently on what we‚Äôre proficient in before we meet to synthesize our output. </strong></p>
                <p class="text-justify"> In addition, through the project with TBP, we really learn how to think critically and analyze problems rationally. <strong>Surprisingly, it turned out that the problem we found about TBP was not the original problem TBP asked us to solve</strong> since
                  there was more data that they have to do to collect in order to figure out the solutions to their original problem. I‚Äôm very proud of my team for being able to think outside the box and identify the real problem and solutions that our
                  client should look into. </p>

                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Some Background Information</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">In a team of 4, we competed in the CHI 2018 Student Design Competition, whose theme this year is "ENGAGE", use human-centred design approaches to develop a new way to support, <i>empower, or change the behaviour of a group around a shared area of interest.</i> Our team decided to focus on the psychological welfare of injured student athletes since after initial survey, 96.5% of injured student athletes reported affected their psychological well-being.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Project Overview</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">Student-athletes usually experience psychological issues during their injured period, which play important roles in their rehabilitation. The three major challenges are loss of identity, isolation, and inability to understand and communicate
                  their recovery progress between checkups. To assist the injured athletes, we propose <strong>AthleteJuvo, a collaborative gaming solution</strong> incorporating routine rehabilitation exercises, team competition, and social supports. Specifically, AthleteJuvo
                  utilizes the <strong>competitive nature of athletes</strong> to gamify the rehabilitation process. Athletes rebuild their identity by forming a team with other injured athletes to compete with their rival schools. AthleteJuvo also helps injured athletes
                  meet nearby injured athletes and connect back with their non-injured team members by sending challenges. To aid in recovery, AthleteJuvo uses <strong>sensing fabric</strong> which collects and reports movement data to the athlete‚Äôs therapist.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Problem Statement</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">For student athletes, getting injured is not only about physical influence. While scholars pointed out that the stressors a student-athlete experiences usually stem from performance; injury, which influences their performance directly,
                  becomes one of the major concerns for student athletes. </p>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Injuries influence athletes not only psychologically but also socially.</strong> Since most of an athlete‚Äôs daily schedule is team-centered, once they get injured, they miss the social interactions they would have had otherwise. Without their regular
                  training and practice, athletes also miss the element of competition in their lives. According to the Mind, Body, and Sport handbook, only 63% of the student-athletes indicated a willingness to ask for help if they have any mental health
                  concerns. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Therefore, our goal is to help injured athletes overcome the psychological issues and strengthen the social support and information they need during their rehabilitation. The key problems we aim to solve are: (1) the <strong>isolation</strong> and the
                  feeling of uselessness during the injured period; (2) the inconvenient methods of <strong>getting advice</strong> from athletes with similar experience; (3) the <strong>lack of support and interaction</strong> from their team members; (4) demotivation by the inability
                  to know their <strong>rehabilitation progress.</strong> </p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Initial User Research</h4>
                <p class="text-justify"> To understand the problems injured athletes encountered in a broader sense, we conducted an online survey where the access was limited to injured athletes only. To get an in-depth understanding of the rehabilitation experience of injured
                  athletes, we held eight semi-structured interviews in this initial stage, including <strong>2 expert interviews and 6 user interviews.</strong></p>
                <p class="text-left"><strong>Phase One: Survey</strong></p>
                <p class="text-left"> An online questionnarie was distributed to sport-related clubs and associations through email lists at the University of Michigan. A total of <strong>87 athletes with injury experience</strong> completed the online survey during a 9-day period, yielding
                  a response rate of 47.2%. The average length of participation in sports is 12.23 years. There were 96.5% of the respondents who replied that the injury affected their psychological well-being as well. Moreover, 92% of them reported suffering
                  from depression and isolation during their rehabilitation.</p>
                <p class="text-left"><strong>Phase Two: Expert Interview</strong></p>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ptoffice.png" alt="UHS PT Clinic">
                <p class="text-justify">We also interviewed one physical therapist at the University of Michigan, and one mental coach from the Facebook group, ‚ÄúThe Injured Athletes Club‚Äù, which is aimed at providing consultation and support for the injured athletes. The physical
                  therapist emphasized that <strong>injured athletes usually suffer from serious anxiety and depression.</strong> The mental coach also stressed that most injured student athletes find it <strong>difficult to let people understand their situation.</strong></p>

                <p class="text-left"><strong>Phase Three: Injured Athletes Interview</strong></p>
                <p class="text-justify">We <strong>interviewed 6 volunteer athletes who were in the rehabilitation process or recently recovered from their injuries.</strong> All interviewees reported that during their injured period, they felt extremely useless, isolated, and
                  experienced a loss of identity. One interviewee even thought about committing suicide during the rehabilitation period. Owing to the fact that an athlete‚Äôs daily schedule is usually team-centered and their social networks usually bond
                  with the team, being injured means that the time spent with their team members decreases. With further investigation, we found that the feeling of being isolated stems from the inability to participate in team activities during the rehabilitation.
                  The feeling of loss of identity derives from lacking the opportunities to work with their team members and compete against other teams.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Besides psychological well-being issues, they all tried to seek help from people who may have similar experiences, and to meet other injured athletes either online or offline to exchange information or get emotional support. When being
                  asking about the inconvenience during rehabilitation, they mentioned keeping track of their rehabilitation progress was difficult, since most of the time physical therapists only provide paper-based tracking sheets, and it is difficult
                  to stay motivated if they cannot see the recovery progress they have made.</p>

                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Initial User Research Results Analysis</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">The results from the survey, expert interview and injured athletes interview shed light on our design directions. We concluded that the core problems injured athletes encounter could be separated into two dimensions:</p>
                <ol>
                 <li class="text-justify"><strong>Psychological
                  Dimension</strong></li>
                   <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify">Being excluded from the team-centered activities due to inability to play causes isolation and feelings of uselessness</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Physical Recovery</strong></li> 
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify">The rehabilitation
                  progress would affect both their physical rehabilitation performance and their mental health</li>
                    <li class="text-justify">Injured athletes would love to be aware of their performance and progress during the rehabilitation</li>
                  </ul>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Persona</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Based on the issues we aim to tackle with, we built personas to help us narrow the design scope. Our target users have the following qualities:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text-justify">Athletes who are in the initial injury stage and need information from athletes who have similar experience.</li>
                  <li class="text-justify">Athletes who are experiencing depression during a stagnant stage of rehabilitation with the need of being motivated, and the sense of achievement and competition.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <!-- <p class="text-justify">The following are the summarized personas:</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><b>Tammy</b> is a junior, and the captain of the varsity rugby team at the University of Michigan. During one of the pre-season practices, she got a partial ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) and sprained LCL (lateral collateral ligament)
                  tear. She hopes to recover as soon as possible so she attempts to connect with other athletes to get useful recovery tips.</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><b>Jason</b> is a senior on the varsity rowing team at the University of Michigan. He got into a serious car accident a few months ago. His rehabilitation has been lengthy, tedious, and strenuous. During his months of recovery, he has
                  not been able to participate in any game or practice with his teammates, which makes him very depressed and isolated. Due to the length of his rehabilitation, he also struggles to feel his progress. The exercises just seem to be repetitive
                  and dull, and he gradually loses his motivation to perform the rehabilitation sessions.</p> -->
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Technology Analysis</h4>
                <!--img slide: devices-->
                <p class="text-justify">In order to encourage and motivate athletes to complete their rehabilitation exercises, we decided to adopt available technologies to record and visualize their recovery progress. Our original technology solutions include:
                <ul>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Smart bands:</strong> Athletes can wear around their head or limbs to detect heart rate and motions</li>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Kinect:</strong> While athletes are in rehab center or at home, Kinect can help them detect the correctness of their gestures more accurately</li>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Wearable sensing fabric:</strong> Combined with the use of a motion detector chip, the extension of elastic fabric allows for detection of various motion degrees and more body parts at the same time.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">However, after interviewing some target users, we realized that although all of the proposals above could work in terms of recording body movement data, <strong>none of them could be carried
                  around easily or attached on different injured body parts</strong> except for the wearable sensing fabric. Therefore, we decided to incorporate wearable sensing fabric as our movement recording solution.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The technology of sensing fabrics has been widely discussed in chemical engineering and information technology fields due to their versatility. It has been implemented in cardiovascular disease sensors, electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram
                  (EMG) sensors, and even respiration or temperature sensors. Wearable sensing fabric is suitable for injured athletes for its high flexibility which <strong>allows it to attach on any injured parts and accurately measure strain, rotation, and
                  flexion movements commonly found in rehabilitation exercises.</strong></p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Idea Generation</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/brainstorm.JPG" alt="Ideation">
                <p class="text-justify">From the initial user research, personas, and technology analysis, we concluded our <strong>key design directions</strong>: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text-justify">Bond injured athletes with their non-injured teammates more closely, and make both parties participate in the
                  same activities to provide injured athletes a sense of contribution and competition as a team.</li>
                  <li class="text-justify">Use wearable sensing fabric as a means of recording athletes‚Äô rehabilitation progress.</li>
                  <li class="text-justify">Connect injured athletes together while providing ways for them to find companionship and fun.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">The Solution - AthleteJuvo</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">We designed AthleteJuvo with the goals of helping injured athletes rebuild the feeling of teamwork and competition, and connect with other athletes with similar experience. AthleteJuvo is a mobile application that utilizes smart fabric
                  technology to gamify, visualize, and socialize the rehabilitation process for injured athletes.</p>
                <br>
                <!-- <p class="text-justify"><strong>Key Features</strong></p> -->
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/key features.png" alt="Key features">
                <ul>
                  <li class="text-justify">Keep a rehabilitation exercise log using a wearable sensing fabric patch</li>
                  <li class="text-left">Gamify the rehabilitation process</li>
                  <li class="text-justify">Build a sense of competition in athletes - Compete in rehabilitation exercise against their rival school</li>
                  <li class="text-justify">Instill a sense of cooperation - Form a team with injured athletes from the same school</li>
                  <li class="text-justify">Encourage athletes to do their rehabilitation exercise regularly</li>
                  <li class="text-left">Search for and meet nearby injured athletes</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify"><!-- In the initial user interviews, athletes reported that one of the stress points they suffered during the injury period was the unawareness of their rehabilitation progress. Therefore, creating visualized data and keeping them informed
                  is a crucial part of the rehabilitation process. --> <strong>Detection: </strong>Our team decided to utilize sensing fabric to detect and record rehabilitation data. The rehabilitation tasks are assigned by their physical therapists. Also, the sensing fabric
                  patch detects the amount the fabric has stretched. Once the fabric is worn over moving joints or injured muscles, the repetitions can be easily counted to allow the user to keep track of their progress.</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Competition: </strong>Without their regular training and practice, they miss the element of competition in their lives. In order to rebuild the feelings of teamwork and competition, and to encourage athletes to conduct their rehabilitation sessions thoroughly,
                  we utilize their zeal for competing by pairing those from the same school and pitting their rehabilitation progress against a rival school. The rival schools are selected on the basis of how well their injured athletes are recovering.</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Engagement: </strong>AthleteJuvo engages and bonds athletes together. Injured athletes will get extra points by sending challenges to non-injured team members. </p>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Connection: </strong>While rehabilitation exercises are usually repetitive tasks, athletes often
                  reported them to be <strong>strenuous in the earlier phases or boring in the later phases</strong> of their recovery. Therefore, AthleteJuvo encourages nearby athletes to meet and finish their rehabilitation sessions together. Once another injured athlete
                  is detected being in the same area, AthleteJuvo notifies and asks the user if s/he wants to do the rehabilitation exercises with the approaching user.</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Progress: </strong>From the interview data, we affirmed that athletes get frustrated easily if they cannot see the progress of their performance during rehabilitation. AthleteJuvo visualizes their progress on a daily basis to motivate them.</p>
                <h4
                  class="text-left text-capitalize">User Evaluation</h4>
                  <p class="text-justify">We went through two iterations to test our design solutions. First we created sketches and generated a low-fidelity prototype. We then invited five participants to test the low-fidelity prototype. The participants were asked to perform
                    the following tasks, with our team members using a Wizard of Oz technique:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify">Attaching the sensing fabric on any of their joints or muscles, and starting the rehabilitation exercise.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify">Users liked the idea of AthleteJuvo because they felt the gaming solution does provide them the satisfaction of competition</li>
                    <li class="text-justify">They wish to get <strong>a greater sense of competition</strong> by having features such as taunting their rival schools</li>
                    <li class="text-justify">Besides daily progress, they wish to see their monthly or <strong>long-term progress</strong> as well</li>
                    <li class="text-justify">They wish to know the sports the other injured athletes play</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="text-justify">Based on the feedback, we decided to add a <strong>calendar</strong> and more statistics visualization to show the progress, and add a feature that allows athletes to <strong>taunt rival teams and cheer for those in the same school.</strong> When other injured athletes
                    are nearby, the application shows the sports they play.</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">After refining our interface, we then invited five more participants to test the ideas. The main feedback includes:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify">Users like the intuitive design, simple but energetic vibe of the interface, mentioning that it makes the rehabilitation exercises more fun.</li>
                    <li class="text-justify">Some users were confused about the scoring system.</li>
                    <li class="text-justify">Some of them did not know that they could get extra points by sending challenges to their non-injured teammates.</li>

                  <p class="text-justify">The users‚Äô feedback confirmed that it would be better to have a clear guide or tutorials for the features and scoring system. Our users were fond of the idea of making the rehabilitation competitive. One of the participants commented:
                    <strong>‚ÄúI think it (AthleteJuvo) is cool because a lot of athletes struggle emotionally. When you get injuries, you are out of sport, and sport is your identity. So I think it is gaining it back and making it competitive through rehab, I
                    like this a lot.‚Äù</strong></p>
                  <h4 class="text-left text-capitalize">Conclusion</h4>
                  <p class="text-justify">AthleteJuvo is a gaming solution aimed at helping injured athletes get support from people with similar cases, solving the sense of estrangement from the team, and encouraging and motivating injured athletes to do their rehabilitation
                    exercises regularly while providing them a sense of participating in team sports again. Our evaluation demonstrated that athletes considered the ideas and features to be very practical and fun. We believe, through AthleteJuvo, athletes could be better understood and be engaged in both the injured athlete community and non-injured athlete community.</p>
